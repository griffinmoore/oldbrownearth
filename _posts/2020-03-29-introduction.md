My name is Griffin Moore. I currently live in Brooklyn, New York and work remotely as a user-interface designer for a software company. I've created this blog to log different things I am reading and thinking about as I consider the next stage in my life. I don't expect any mass-appeal, but simply feel an urge to compile some of ideas I have come across over the years.

In particular I hope to post findings on the subjects of designing shelter, decentralism and degrowth, and the pursuit of self-sufficiency. Living off-grid has been a personal interest of mine since my early 20s (now 31 years old). I've done a fair bit of reading on the subject, but living in New York City has prevented me from accruing any actual experience. So I am just a student and that is the tone I wish to communicate.

I am writing this during the COVID-19 pandemic which has essentially put the planet on lockdown. This development has reinforced for me the critical importance of self-reliance– a concept we in the United States and in similar nations have moved dangerously far from. Perhaps not entirely by our own design, but spurred on by the coercive force of industrialization.

Of course, industrialization and standardization have afforded us several luxuries. It's one thing to design an off-grid existence within an industrial society– benefitting from the incredible access to goods and services– but can the system be redesigned in a way to meet a good standard of comfort while respecting all people and planet? Undoubtedly it will require significant cultural change. How we source energy, how we eat, how we build, how we travel– practically every aspect of our lives is, in this moment, performed without adequate consideration of the whole. I suppose this is the lofty question I wish to consider here. How can we better design our society for the benefit of everyone?
