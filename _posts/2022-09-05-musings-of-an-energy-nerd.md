I think I came across the [Passivhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house) standard a couple years ago. My understanding of the model is using passive solar, insulation, and a very tight shell to regulate home temperature– and thereby energy use as typically most energy is committed to heating and cooling. But achieving the Passivhaus standard is quite costly– requiring expensive certifications and specialized components.

Through a bit more research I encountered the notion of a "Pretty Good House," a term coined by [Michael Maines](https://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/article/the-pretty-good-house) I believe, to describe a house still designed thoughtfully, but a bit less stringently than one following the Passivhaus model. Martin Holladay expanded upon this idea with his "Pretty Good House Manifesto." Holladay has written for Green Building Advisor since January 2009 under the title ["Musings of an Energy Nerd,"](https://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blog/musings) a blog which spawned a [book](https://www.tauntonstore.com/musings-of-an-energy-nerd) of the same name in 2017.

The book is very detailed and offers practical assessments of various technologies and approaches one should consider when designing a modern technological home. I did a quick read-through, not diving too deep into the details, but pulled out some of the recommendations below.

* Windows in hot climate– and west-facing windows in almost all climates– need glazing with solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) of 0.30 or lower
* In hot climate, east and west facing windows minimized
* In cold climate, triple-glazed windows on north, east, west facing windows at least, perhaps south too
* Drain-water heat-recovery device (ex. GFX/Power-Pipe) saves 15–22% of energy used for water heating
* No ductwork in unconditioned areas like an attic
* Tight home requires mechanical ventilation system. Cold climate: HRV or ERV (energy-recovery ventilator) with dedicated ventilation ductwork. Pull stale air from bathrooms and laundry room and deliver fresh air to living rooms. Mixed or hot climate: central fan integrated supply ventilation system.
* Blower door test: Passivhaus standard 0.6 ACH50. 1.6–1.8 ACH50 is better than most. Test before drywall hung.
* Window in shower problematic
* Avoid ducts– instead ductless minisplits/Lumos ventilation fans
* No skylights
* An unconditioned vented attic is better than an insulated roof
* Roof: simple gable for cold climate, hipped roof for hot climate, generous overhangs
* Asphalt felt better than synthetic roofing underlayment
* Asphalt shingles or metal roofing (through-fastened steel roofing)
* Basement: 9ft walls to account for ducts and pipes
* 4in thick layer of crushed stone under basement slab as capilary break, stone needs to be vented through roof to control radon
* Horizontal rigid foam over stone, polyethylene above foam (under slab) as vapor barrier
* North America 5-10-20-40-60 rule: windows R-5, basement slab R-10, basement walls R-20, walls R-40, attics/roofs R-60
