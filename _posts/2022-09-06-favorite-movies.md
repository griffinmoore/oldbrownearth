The moment everyone has been waiting for– the countdown of my current top five movies.

### 5\. Five Easy Pieces (1970)

Not an uplifting film, but not terribly depressing either. Feels realistic in its ups and downs. Some great memorable scenes and dialogue. One of my favorite scenes is a lengthy car ride diatribe against filth.

### 4\. Local Hero (1983)

The kind of movie I'd like to live in. Picturesque setting, characters, and an overall feeling of tenderness. Has a bit of magic realism which I'm a sucker for.

### 3\. Desert Hearts (1985)

Beautiful movie in the desert. Love the character dynamics, old-timey dialogue, costumes, music– just a great film. I've watched it four times over the five months since I found it.

### 2\. Being There (1979)

One of the funniest movies I have ever seen, but it's not exactly a comedy. Leaves a great impact.

### 1\. Harold and Maude (1971)

Life-affirming movie with an incredible soundtrack by Yusuf Islam (Cat Stevens at the time). Has been my favorite for something like 13 years and it's difficult to imagine it being displaced.
